        <h5>Batsman(Opener)</h5>
        <p>• He was selected for the Bangladesh squad for ICC World Cup 2007 when he was just 4 ODI matches old. He surprised everyone with his wonderful knock of 51 against India taking his side to the victory.
        
            • In ICC World Cup 2011 against India, he was the only dominant player in the team to challenge the Indian seamers as well as spinners. Unfortunately, the result was not in their favour, but they got a mesmerising cricketer at the end of the day.</p>

        <h2>Mushfiqur Rahim</h2>
        <h5>Wicket-keeper Batsman</h5>
        <p>An absolute livewire behind the stumps, Mushfiqur Rahim, fits the clichéd description of wicket-keepers aptly. He is short, very quick behind the stumps, always chuntering away and a brilliant batsman as well. He was initially picked as an understudy to Khaled Mashud for the tour of England in 2005, but as he impressed everyone with his competence with the bat in the tour games, he was made to play as a specialist batsman in the first Test at the age of 16. He thus became the youngest player to play at Lord's. An ankle injury forced him out of the side for a while before being recalled to the side for the tour of Zimbabwe in 2006. His consistent performances saw him pip Mashud as the first choice wicket-keeper for the 2007 World Cup in West Indies. He was soon a part of the Test squad, too, and sealed his spot with a 80 against Sri Lanka in only his third Test.</p>

        <h2>Mahmudullah Riad</h2>
        <h5>All-rounder</h5>
        <p>Like Sanath Jayasuriya, Kevin Pietersen, Shoaib Malik, Steve Smith and many more, Mahmudullah started his career as a bowler and then converted into a batsman who could bowl handy off-breaks. He became the first Bangladeshi World Cup centurion when he scored 103 against England at the Adelaide Oval that helped his team reach the knockout stage for the first time.
        
            Born in Mymensingh, Mahmudullah made his first-class debut for Bangladesh A at the age of 19 and posted scores of 55 and 42 against Zimbabwe A. He made his debut in international cricket in an ODI against Sri Lanka in July 2007 and made an instant impact picking up 2 wickets and scored 36 runs but the effort went in vain as Bangladesh came up short. The performance was enough to convince the selectors to pick him for the tour to Kenya and the T20 World Cup later that year. He was briefly dropped from the side in 2008 but worked his way back with phenomenal domestic performances to earn a recall.</p>

        <h2>Mohammad Ashraful</h2>
        <h5>All-rounder</h5>
        <p>Mohammad Ashraful is one of the shining lights of Bangladesh cricket in 2000s but fell into the spot-fixing trap. He is still an active cricketer and wouldn't be any surprise if he makes a comeback.</p>

In fact, he is the only bowler to take a total of 11 wickets in his first two games. In his 3rd ODI against India, he took 2 wickets and made history by taking 13 wickets in a 3-match ODI series.</p>

        <h2>Mohammad Rubel Hossain</h2>
        <h5>Bowler</h5>
        <p>Mohammad Rubel Hossain is a Bangladeshi bowler who was born on 1 January 1990 in Khulna, Bangladesh. He is regarded as the fastest bowler in Bangladesh cricket history. Hossain is hailed as Bangladesh's Malinga because of his slight sling action.
        
        
        
            He is a right-handed batsman and a right arm fast bowler. For someone who began playing cricket with taped tennis bowl in his hometown Bagerhat, Hossain's rise in international cricket has been pretty impressive.</p>

        <h2>Mehidy Hasan Miraz</h2>
        <h5>All-rounder</h5>
        <p>Mehidy had a dream debut series as a Test player. After the remarkable 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup there was never any doubt in the team management's mind that they had found themselves an exceptional talent - in fact, in an echo of Australia's unveiling of Shane Warne on the 1993 Ashes tour. He was expected to debut a month ago for Afghanistan ODIs but was deliberately omitted to keep him as a secret from England.[19]
        
            On 20 October 2016, Mehidy made his Test debut against England. Even though he is an off break bowler, he opened the bowling in his maiden Test innings.[20] Ben Duckett, another debutant in the same Test match, became Mehidy's first Test wicket. In the same match he also became the seventh and youngest Bangladesh player to take a five-wicket haul on debut in a Test.[21] In his 2nd Test match he became the sixth bowler to take three five-for in his first two Tests and took 19 wickets in the Test series and became the 9th player overall and 1st from Bangladesh to win the man-of-the-series award in debut Test series.[22][23][24]
            
            Even though he had a horrible series as a batsman scored only 5 runs in 4 innings at an average of 1.25, Mushfiqur Rahim lauded the performances of the 19-year-old, and insisted Mehidy still has much more to offer. He said " Mehidyi is a good batsman also. He didn't show that now, but hopefully in future he will be a great all-rounder for Bangladesh".[25][26] For his sensational debut series against England a new house from Bangladesh's prime minister was gifted to him.[27]
            
            In November 2018, in the second Test against the West Indies, Hasan took the best match figures by a Bangladesh bowler in Tests, finishing with twelve wickets for 117 runs.[28]</p>

        <h2>Md. Nasir Hossain</h2>
        <h5>All-rounder</h5>
        <p>He made his ODI debut on 14 August 2011 against Zimbabwe. Coming in with Bangladesh's score at 58 for 6, the 19-year-old Hossain top-scored for his side with 63 runs from 92 balls, lifting the score to 188. It was not enough, and Zimbabwe won by seven wickets.[10] In the final game of the five-match series, Hossain accidentally injured Zimbabwe fast bowler Keegan Meth. Hossain drove a delivery from Meth straight back and the bowler was unable to get out of the way. He was struck in the mouth, knocking out three teeth.[11]
        
            After losing the ODI series against Zimbabwe 3–2, Bangladesh hosted the West Indies in October for a T20I, three ODIs, and two Tests. In the second ODI, he scored his second half-century. He again came to the wicket with Bangladesh struggling and scored 50 from 54 deliveries.[12] In the final match of the ODI series, which Bangladesh lost 2–1, Hossain took his first wickets in the format. His first was that of left-handed opening batsman Kieran Powell with a delivery that pitched on leg stump and spun to hit the off stump. On a turning pitch Hossain's two wickets for three runs (2/3) helped Bangladesh bowl West Indies out for 61, their second lowest score, and win the match.[13]
            
            Starting in November, Pakistan toured Bangladesh. In the second of three ODIs Hossain scored his maiden international century. He scored 100 runs off 134 balls and was selected Man of the Match for his efforts, though Bangladesh found lost.[14] He scored his maiden test century against Sri Lanka at Galle on 11 March 2013. He scored 100 off 151 balls with 9 fours. And in the 1st ODI against Sri Lanka he scored At Sooriyawewa, Hambantota on 23 March 2013 he played a magnificent innings of 73 of 59 ball and he was not out. In 3rd ODI The Bangladesh dugout is ecstatic and it has been a brilliant innings under pressure by Nasir Hossain 33(27b).[15]
            
            In 2015, he helped Bangladesh to their most successful run in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. On 12 July, he got his career best 3 for 26 against South Africa to help them win the second ODI and subsequently leading to the series win over the proteas. His catches has been very vital in Bangladesh winning the series against India and South Africa.</p>
